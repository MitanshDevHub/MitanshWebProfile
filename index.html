      <h3>WEBSITE REDESIGN</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Course:</strong> ITMD 362: Human-Computer Interaction and Web Design - IIT Chicago
      </p>
      
      <p>
          <strong>Synopsis:</strong> For this project, our team chose to revamp the website for 
          <a href="https://www.worldialogue.org/" target="_blank">Worldialogue</a>. Noted for its overlapping images, scant content, 
          and malfunctioning social media links, the original design left much room for improvement.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>Redesign Highlights:</strong></p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>Home Page:</strong> Overcome challenges like oddly placed images by introducing a slideshow for smoother design continuity. Enhanced responsiveness for better mobile user experience and refined the footer’s padding.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>ISUD Journal Page:</strong> Updated @media queries to ensure content adapts effectively at different screen sizes. Incorporated a fresh color theme, improved spacing within text, and introduced key quotes for a quick journal preview.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Membership Page:</strong> Integrated a more user-friendly membership application form. Diversified payment methods beyond just PayPal, and optimized the mobile view by fixing header dimensions and repositioning the logo.
          </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
          Throughout this project, our focus was firmly on user-centered design principles. We applied grid-based designs, adopted a mobile-first approach, and utilized GitHub for an agile, iterative design and development process.

        <h3>SECURITY DEVICE SIMULATION</h3>
        <p><strong>Course:</strong> CS 330: Discrete Structures - IIT Chicago</p>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
        This program simulates a security device akin to those used in homes and offices. Users or random number generators input strings, with the program deciding if the correct access code has been entered. The program provides feedback on its current state (locked or unlocked) and furnishes statistics about the number of attempts, successful unlocks, and locks.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SecurityEngine.py:</strong> Manages the locking and unlocking mechanism. Accepts user input to alter the device's state, filters out non-digit characters, and keeps stats on the number of attempts and the state changes.</li>
            <li><strong>ranNumGen.py:</strong> Simulates brute force attacks on the security device. This class attempts to unlock the device without any time delay and then computes the average time required if there's a one-second wait between each attempt.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Findings:</strong> While a human might take roughly 7-8 days to break the lock given a one-second wait time, computers can decipher the code in mere seconds. It accentuates the importance of robust cybersecurity in this digital age.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> With the advent of quantum computing, it's paramount to re-evaluate and fortify security measures. This project was implemented using Python and is grounded on the principles of Finite Automata.</p>

      <h3>REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION</h3>
      <p><strong>Course:</strong> CS-425: Database Organization - IIT Chicago</p>
      
      <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br>
        This application is a conceptual embodiment of a comprehensive real estate management solution. Developed using Django in conjunction with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, it's designed to proficiently handle property listings, streamline the relationships between clients, landlords, and agents, and oversee transactions in the real estate sector. Although the underlying code is robust and feature-rich, there were challenges in achieving seamless front-end to back-end communication, making it more of a representational prototype than a fully operational platform.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Achievements & Features:</strong></p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Utilized Django as the back-end framework combined with HTML/CSS/JavaScript for front-end development, forming the base of the application.</li>
          <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> Architected and rolled out a robust PostgreSQL database schema which is the backbone for all the functionalities provided by the application, from listing properties to managing transactions.</li>
          <li><strong>ER to Relational Mapping:</strong> Initiated the process with an ER-model and then adeptly translated it into a functional relational schema using SQL scripts.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges Met:</strong> Encountered challenges like form validation discrepancies, unexpected server responses, and intricacies of Django's template system. While I addressed many of these concerns, some complexities, especially in the front-end to back-end communication,remained.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrated Solution:</strong> Aimed to ensure a harmonious blend of the front-end and back-end components for an ideal user experience. However, some integration challenges persisted, emphasizing the prototype nature of the project.</li>
      </ul>
